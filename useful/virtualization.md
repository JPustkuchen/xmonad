## Misc
* Enabling 3D Acceleration can result in reduced CPU performance (if you are experiencing reduced performance compared to VirtualBox try turning it off)

## Settings
* Under `Preferences > Display` disable the option `Show toolbar edge when unpinned in full screen`
* Under `Preferences > Hot Keys` set the hot key to your preference (e.g. `SHIFT + ALT + WIN`)
* Make sure the amount of processors and cores per processors is reflected correctly
